#Construct a regular expression that matches each of these (one regular expression per item). You do not need to include the contents of an entire script for each of these; rather, include just the line with the regular expression. For example, if you are asked to match "cat or hat", you could simply answer: r”(c|h)at”

#1 at least one b followed by any number (zero or more) of c's
r"b+c*"

#2 any number (one or more) of literal backslashes followed by any number (zero or more) of literal asterisks 
r"\\+\**"

#3 three consecutive copies of whatever text is contained in the whatever variable 

#4 any five characters (they don't have to be the same, and this includes newline as a valid character option) (re.S or re.DOTALL makes "." include newlines as a valid character option.  
r".{5}," re.S

#5 [Challenging!] the same word written two or more times in a row (with possible varying intervening whitespace), where "word" is defined as a non-empty sequence of non-whitespace characters. No points off if you don't get this one, I'm just looking to be impressed.
