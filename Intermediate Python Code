#2 Before you start to write the next script, first run the 'who' command at the UNIX prompt and redirect it into a file named users.txt. (Then, look at the file and study its format!) Afterwards, write a program that reads in and uses the 'split' function to break up each line of the 'users.txt' file into three variables: who, where, and when_and_IP, and then reprints it to the screen in this format: who on where at when_and_IP. So, if your text input file contains three lines, I expect to see code that produce three lines of output, each of which will look like: bsd17 on ttyp0 at Aug09 08:07 (132.85.201.182).
