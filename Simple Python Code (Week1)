#1	Write a program that computes the circumference of a circle with a radius of 7.5 and prints out the result. The circumference is 2 * pi * radius. You can use the value of 3.14159 for pi. 1.	Write a program that computes the circumference of a circle with a radius of 7.5 and prints out the result. The circumference is 2 * pi * radius. You can use the value of 3.14159 for pi.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
radius = 7.5
pi = 3.14159
circumference = 2 * pi * radius
print (circumference)


#2 Write a program that multiplies two hard-coded numbers, then prints the individual numbers out and prints their product out, all on separate lines. You can choose the two numbers that are multiplied together. 

#!/usr/bin/env python3
num1 = 6
print('number 1 is', num1)
num2 = 8
print('number 2 is', num2)
product = num1 * num2
print ('product is', product)


#3	Make a copy of 2 but modify it to print output exactly like this, rather than just the numbers on separate lines: 
10 x 7 = 70

#!/usr/bin/env python3
num1 = 10
num2 = 7
product = num1 * num2
print ("{0} x {1} = {2}".format(num1,num2,product))


#4	Start a script with the following line:
dna = 'ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG' 
Then write a program to generate the following output: 
The length of your sequence is: 28 
The first codon is: ATG 
You should not print these values (hard-coded) directly. Instead, they should be calculated based on the sequence stored within the dna variable. (That is, if you change the sequence in dna the program should still work accordingly.)

#!/usr/bin/env python3
dna = 'ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG'
length = len(dna)
codon = dna[0:3]
print("The length of your sequence is: {0}\nThe first codon is: {1}".format(length, codon))


#5	Starting with the same dna variable assignment above, write another script to perform calculations whose output would be: There are 2 instances of the motif 'AA' You should be able to change the motif and it automatically count how many times it is found in your sequence. 

#!/usr/bin/env python3
dna = 'ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG'
motif = 'AA'
count = dna.count(motif)
print("There are {0} instances of the motif '{1}'".format(count, motif))
